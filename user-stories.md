"As a socialite I want to be able to be seen at the places people most desire to visit so they will envy me.""

"I travel a lot for leisure and I want to be in the know of the hot travel destinations so I can make my travel plans." 

"As a travel writer I need to know where people want to travel so that I can visit and gather information for my blog."
